# Adgenerate
Create digital ad templates for a few DoubleClick and Sizmek, as well as a generic container.  The original development of this was done in 2015.  While DoubleClick still works, I haven't worked with Sizmek in many years.  The specifics were valid as of late 2015 / early 2016.  YMMV.

## Installation
This was written on macOS and is untested on Windows. The following directions are for macOS.

1. Copy adgenerate to wherever you tend to put ad files.
2. Open Terminal and `cd` to the folder.
3. Run `chmod 755 adgenerate`
4. Run `./adgenerate` and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can run `php /path/to/adgenerate` if you don't want to deal with / can't set permissions.
